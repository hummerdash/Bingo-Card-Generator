# Bingo-Card-Generator
Creates custom Bingo cards

Simply download Processing and run the code.

It is quite simple to understand what each value is doing. So feel free to change and modify.

I wrote this on a hurry because I couldn't find a generator that creates pintable cards.

For tweaking the layout please set

  <code>boolean save = false;</code>
  
otherwise it alwasy creates a bunch of png files...

If you change the font or fontsize, make sure you adjust all the adjusters in the code... titleAdjuster, freeAdjuster, genAdjuster...

BINGO!
